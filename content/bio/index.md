I am a graduate research assistant. For over two years at Southampton Business School, under supervision of [Dr. Sasan
Barak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=C53gU8gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) we studied the applications of deep learning methods and time series analysis in improving
time series forecasting. We applied deep-learning models in the meta-learning framework
to enhance time series forecasting model-selection. We also generated synthetic time series, with
variational autoencoder (VAE), to improve deep learning forecasting generalization performance.
Our research contributions in the time series forecasting literature lead to the presentation of two
python packages:
 1. [MetaTS](https://github.com/DrSasanBarak/metats): Time Series Forecasting using Meta Learning.
 2. [AugmentTS](https://github.com/DrSasanBarak/AugmentTS):Time Series Data Augmentation using Deep Generative Models.

I am generally curious about intersection of deep learing, reinforcement learning and optimization. My main areas of interest include:
  - Variational inference, Generative models
  - Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning
  - Time Series Analysis, Distributionally Robust Optimization
 
 Previously I have worked on:
 
  - Time series forecasting. 
  - Generating synthetic time series with generative model, e.g., VAE.
  - Data-driven distributionally robust learning.
  - Reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization.
  - End-to-end integrated learning and optimization.
